# DeepFake-Detection

## Project Overview
This Deep Fake Detection system is designed to identify manipulated media, focusing on images, using advanced machine learning techniques. It employs TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks to analyze visual content and distinguish between genuine and altered media.

## Key Features
- Utilization of TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning model development.
- Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer model.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset Overview
The project uses the "Deepfake and Real Images" dataset from Kaggle, consisting of real and deepfake-generated images.

### Dataset Details
**Source**: Sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images], provided by user Manjil Karki, which is a part of the OpenForensics dataset [https://zenodo.org/records/5528418#.YpdlS2hBzDd]. This dataset is specifically designed for the challenging task of multi-face forgery detection and segmentation in-the-wild.
